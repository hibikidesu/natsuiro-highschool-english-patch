string113 = 007007sb0030240
string114 = It doesn't mean anything bad,
string115 = As expected, a fairy in this year
string116 = I can't believe it ... that?
string117 = Hey, hold on, okay? Hold on.
string118 = So just let's talk more normally!
string119 = Wow, that's a lie. I've already gone ...
string120 = (It's hard to keep up with that glue,
string121 = I thought I should say it clearly)
string122 = ...... I wonder if I overdo it again.
string123 = (But I don't feel like I can speak well with that glue.
string124 = It ’s harder to believe.)
string125 = Hah. After all, that child is
string126 = It seems better to ask Okami-senpai ...
string127 = (I'm really sorry I couldn't help you, Mr. Kiku)
string128 = - l don't know.

string132 = 007007sb0030250
string133 = Hey, is there really a fairy beside you?
string134 = Can't you show up in front of us?
string135 = 007007sb0030260
string136 = ...... Fairy, let's go home soon.
string137 = You have to be careful of people you don't know.
string138 = Well, wait a minute! ??
string139 = Why did you escape suddenly?
string140 = I didn't mean to say that harsh.
string141 = I wonder if I was still wary ...
string142 = (In that condition, it seems that it will be avoided for the time being)
string143 = (Maybe I should have talked more slowly.
string144 = Kiku's clue,
string145 = It's gone ...)
